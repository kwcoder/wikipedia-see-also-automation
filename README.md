# Automation of "See Also" section in Wikipedia articles
This repository contains the files submitted for my Data Science Group Project as part of my MSc Data Science course, for which I was awarded a Merit. This specific project was awarded a Distinction (76.3%).

# Project Summary
This project automates the creation of "See Also" sections in Wikipedia articles, improving link relevance and navigation across the most popular 60,000 English Wikipedia articles. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and semantic vector analysis, the system generates tailored recommendations using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to create semantic vectors. These vectors are combined with article-specific features to deliver links that are contextually relevant. 

Key findings show that 58.36% of surveyed Wikipedia editors preferred the automated "See Also" lists over manually created ones. This highlights the potential of ML and NLP technologies in enhancing connectivity within digital informational ecosystems - particularly those reliant on volunteer contributions, such as Wikipedia.
